# atom-multiline-bracket
Split the enclosed contents of `{}`, `()`, and `{}` over multiple lines in atom.

Use <kbd>ctrl-alt-m</kbd> to split a matching pair of `{}`, `()`, or `{}` in the current line of the cursor.

This tool supports one match on a single line only (for now).
For multiple cursors, it will take the most recently added cursor as the target.
